# ðŸ“„ PDF Q&A Chatbot

### Project Description

This project is a conversational AI application that allows users to ask questions about the content of any PDF document. It leverages a modern approach called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide factual and accurate answers. The entire application, from the file upload to the chat interface, is built using **Streamlit**.

### Key Features

- **Document-Grounded Answers:** Provides answers that are strictly based on the content of the uploaded PDF, minimizing the risk of "hallucinations."
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Integrates an efficient RAG pipeline to retrieve the most relevant information from the document before generating a response.
- **Conversational Memory:** Remembers the context of previous questions to enable natural, multi-turn conversations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive web interface powered by Streamlit for easy file uploads and real-time interaction.
